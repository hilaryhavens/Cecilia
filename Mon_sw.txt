      I bring you a subject of sorrow in a young lady who never gave disturbance to her friends but in quitting them
Come Morrice you that love Christmas sports what say you to the game of move-all
      So should I too were I to remove from any seat but this
      We are going to lose you and you seem concerned at leaving us yet in a very few months you will forget Bury forget its inhabitants and forget its environs
      You will find as you mix with the world you will find that Lady Margaret has but expressed what by almost every body is thought to neglect old friends and to court new acquaintance though perhaps not yet avowedly delivered as a precept from parents to children is nevertheless so universally recommended by example that those who act differently incur general censure for affecting singularity
      And such at first setting out in life is the intention of every one The closet reasoner is always refined in his sentiments and always confident in his virtue but when he mixes with the world when he thinks less and acts more he soon finds the necessity of accomodating himself to such customs as are already received and of pursuing quietly the track that is already marked out
      Deviations from common rules when they proceed from genius are not merely pardonable but admirable and you Belfield have a peculiar right to plead their merits but so little genius as there is in the world you must surely grant that pleas of this sort are very rarely to be urged
      All this is but the doctrine of a lively imagination that looks upon impossibilities simply as difficulties and upon difficulties as mere invitations to victory But experience teaches another lesson experience shews that the opposition of an individual to a community is always dangerous in the operation and seldom successful in the event never indeed without a concurrence strange as desirable of fortunate circumstances with great abilities
      I am ready enough to allow that an excentric genius such for example as yours may murmur at the tediousness of complying with the customs of the world and wish unconfined and at large to range through life without any settled plan or prudential restriction but would you therefore grant the same licence to every one would you wish to see the world peopled with defiers of order and contemners of established forms and not merely excuse the irregularities resulting from uncommon parts but encourage those also to lead who without blundering cannot even follow
I suppose you will not permit an old friend to visit you in town lest the sight of him should prove a disagreeable memorial of the time you will soon regret having wasted in the country
      Temptation is very easy of resistance in theory but if you reflect upon the great change of situation Miss Beverley will experience upon the new scenes she will see the new acquaintance she must make and the new connections she may form you will not wonder at the anxiety of a friend for her welfare
      Where fortune smiles upon youth and beauty do you think it nothing that their fair possessor should make a sudden transition of situation from the quietness of a retired life in the country to the gaiety of a splendid town residence
      What are there not sharpers fortune-hunters sycophants wretches of all sorts and denominations who watch the approach of the rich and unwary feed upon their inexperience and prey upon their property
      Be upon your guard with all new acquaintance judge nobody from appearances form no friendship rashly take time to look about you and remember you can make no alteration in your way of life without greater probability of faring worse than chance of faring better Keep therefore as you are and the more you see of others the more you will rejoice that you neither resemble nor are connected with them
      I spoke of the world in general not of this lady in particular and who that knows who that sees her would not wish it were possible she might continue in every respect exactly and unalterably what she is at present
Why how now Morrice do you take away the privilege of my house
      You are mistaken Sir it is to begin at twelve o’clock
      He is known by fifty names his friends call him the moralist the young ladies the crazy-man the macaronies the bore in short he is called by any and every name but his own
      Indeed I knew almost nothing of him then and I am but little better informed now Belfield picked him up somewhere and desired to bring him to my house he called him by the name of Albany I found him a most extraordinary character and Belfield who is a worshipper of originality was very fond of him
I don’t think you have shewn the ladies any of the contrivances behind the scenes
Miss Beverley what I foresaw has exactly come to pass you are surrounded by selfish designers by interested double-minded people who have nothing at heart but your fortune and whose mercenary views if you are not guarded against them
      I don’t doubt you Sir and but for the check of modesty probably there is not a man here who would not wish the same
Sir you are an impudent fellow a very facetious gentleman
Well who is so handsome here as Harrel’s ward
      No why what is the fault of it
      O you have tried her then have you why you are not in general much given to say civil things
      What then was that all and did you imagine one compliment would do your business with her
      You won’t find she thinks so though for as you well say her pride is insufferable and I who have long known her can assure you it does not diminish upon intimacy
      Are you quite sure the estate is so considerable Report is mightily given to magnify
At present this matter is merely ridiculous I am sorry to think in how short a time it may become more important
      I will with pleasure do whatever you wish but still if Sir Robert
      O as to Sir Robert Mr Harrel I am very sure will undertake him I will try to see him to-night myself and entreat him to exert all his influence
Has Belfield ever visited you since he had the honour of meeting you at my house
Have you seen him often in public
      Is it then for the safety of Sir Robert you are so extremely anxious
But do you not wish better to one of them than to the other
No for before I got to him the challenge had been sent
      I called again this morning at his lodgings but he was not returned home
      None to elude all pursuit he went out before any body in the house was stirring and took his servant with him
      I have been to Cavendish-Square but there it seems he has not appeared all night I traced him through his servants from the Opera to a gaming-house where I found he had amused himself till this morning
      Let me then enquire if yet that ardent confidence in your own steadiness which so much disdained my fears that the change of your residence might produce a change in your sentiments is still as unshaken as when we parted in Suffolk Or whether experience that foe to unpractised refinement has already taught you the fallibility of theory
How so
Is that then disagreeable to you
a change which though ruinous of your time and detrimental to your happiness use will I fear familiarize and familiarity render pleasant
      Because your trial has yet been too short to prove your firmness and because there is nothing to which time cannot contentedly accustom us
      You can wish nothing more judiciously would you then return into the country
      Mrs Delvile Surely you do not think of removing into that family
Are you serious Do you really think of making such a change
      And can Miss Beverley possibly wish to reside in such a house Is not Mr Delvile the most ostentatious haughty and self-sufficient of men Is not his wife the proudest of women And is not the whole family odious to all the world
      Have you often been at the house Do you know the son too
      And what do you think of him
      But what does he seem to you Do you not perceive in him already all the arrogance all the contemptuous insolence of his father
      You are much deceived you have been reading your own mind and thought you had read his I would advise you sedulously to avoid the whole family you will find all intercourse with them irksome and comfortless such as the father appears at once the wife and the son will in a few more meetings appear also They are descended from the same stock and inherit the same self-complacency Mr Delvile married his cousin and each of them instigates the other to believe that all birth and rank would be at an end in the world if their own superb family had not a promise of support from their hopeful Mortimer Should you precipitately settle yourself in their house you would very soon be totally weighed down by their united insolence
      When you gave her that title you had little choice in your power her sweetness and good-nature attracted you childhood is never troubled with foresight and youth is seldom difficult she was lively and pleasing you were generous and affectionate your acquaintance with her was formed while you were yet too young to know your own worth your fondness of her grew from habit and before the inferiority of her parts had weakened your regard by offending your judgment her early marriage separated you from her entirely But now you meet again the scene is altered three years of absence spent in the cultivation of an understanding naturally of the first order by encreasing your wisdom has made you more fastidious while the same time spent by her in mere idleness and shew has hurt her disposition without adding to her knowledge and robbed her of her natural excellencies without enriching her with acquired ones You see her now with impartiality for you see her almost as a stranger and all those deficiencies which retirement and inexperience had formerly concealed her vanity and her superficial acquaintance with the world have now rendered glaring But folly weakens all bands remember therefore if you would form a solid friendship to consult not only the heart but the head not only the temper but the understanding
      You have indeed done me the highest honour 
      Is she civil to you
      Then depend upon it she has something in view whenever that is not the case she is all insolence And Mr Delvile pray what do you think of him
Well and do you not now begin also to see the son properly
      Why as the very son of such parents haughty and impertinent
      You know not that family But how indeed should you when they are in a combination to prevent your getting that knowledge They have all their designs upon you and if you are not carefully upon your guard you will be the dupe to them
      Nothing but what every body else must immediately see they have a great share of pride and a small one of wealth you seem by fortune to be flung in their way and doubtless they mean not to neglect so inviting an opportunity of repairing their estates
      Tricks nothing but tricks to discover your real situation
      There is only one you must peremptorily refuse to go to Violet Bank yourself If after what has passed you are included in the same party with Sir Robert you give a sanction yourself to the reports already circulated of your engagements with him and the effect of such a sanction will be more serious than you can easily imagine since the knowledge that a connection is believed in the world frequently if not generally leads by imperceptible degrees to its real ratification
      I will not however either act or give my opinion without further enquiry as I am confident there is a mystery in this business which lies deeper than we can at present fathom Mr Harrel has doubtless purposes of his own to answer by this pretended zeal for Sir Robert nor is it difficult to conjecture what they may be Friendship in a man of his light cast is a mere cover a mere name to conceal a connection which has its basis solely in the licentious convenience of borrowing money going to the same gaming house and mutually communicating and boasting their mutual vices and intrigues while all the time their regard for each other is equally hollow with their regard for truth and integrity
Have you yet observed the family compact in which those people are bound to besiege you and draw you into their snares
      My dear Miss Beverley I know them already I do not indeed visit them but I am perfectly acquainted with their characters which have been drawn to me by those who are most closely connected with them and who have had opportunities of inspection which I hope will never fall to your share since I am satisfied the trial would pain though the proof would convince you
      I beg your pardon Mrs Delvile is not nearer perfection than the rest of her family she has only more art in disguising her foibles because tho’ she is the daughter of pride she is the slave of interest
      You will know her better hereafter I only hope your knowledge will not be purchased by the sacrifice of your happiness
I will tell you with all the openness you have a claim to from my regard and then leave to time to shew if I am mistaken The Delvile family notwithstanding its ostentatious magnificence I can solemnly assure you is poor in every branch alike lineal and collateral
      Yes because the more rapacious And while they count on each side Dukes Earls and Barons in their genealogy the very wealth with which through your means they project the support of their insolence and which they will grasp with all the greediness of avarice they will think honoured by being employed in their service while the instrument all amiable as she is by which they attain it will be constantly held down as the disgrace of their alliance
I would not give this warning to one I thought too weak to profit from it but as I am well informed of the use that is meant to be made of your fortune and the abuse that will follow of yourself I think it right to prepare you for their artifices which merely to point out may render abortive
      Justly or unjustly I am at least sure you can never plead vainly I give up therefore to your opinion my attack of Mrs Delvile and am willing from your commendations to suppose her the best of the race Nay I will even own that perhaps Mr Delvile himself as well as his lady might pass through life and give but little offence had they only themselves to think of and no son to stimulate their arrogance
      The son I believe is at least the chief incentive to insolence and ostentation in the parents since it is for his sake they covet with such avidity honours and riches since they plume themselves upon regarding him as the support of their name and family and since their pride in him even surpasses their pride in their lineage and themselves
      Their purpose therefore is to secure through his means your fortune which they will no sooner obtain than to my certain knowledge they mean instantly and most unmercifully to employ it in repairing all their dilapidated estates
Miss Beverley I bring you intelligence which though I know you will be very sorry to hear it is absolutely necessary should be told you immediately you may otherwise from however laudable motives be drawn into some action which you may repent for life
      All that I suspected and more than I hinted to you is true Mr Harrel is a ruined man he is not worth a groat and he is in debt beyond what he ever possessed
      My enquiries have been among principals and such as would not dare deceive me I hastened therefore to you that this timely notice might enforce the injunctions I gave you when I had the pleasure of seeing you last and prevent a misjudging generosity from leading you into any injury of your own fortune for a man who is past all relief from it and who cannot be saved even though you were to be destroyed for his sake
But why before you signed your name to so base an imposition could you not send for me
      An oath so forced the most delicate conscience would have absolved you from performing You have indeed been grossly imposed upon and pardon me if I add unaccountably to blame Was it not obvious that relief so circumstanced must be temporary If his ruin had been any thing less than certain what tradesmen would have been insolent You have therefore deprived yourself of the power of doing good to a worthier object merely to grant a longer date to extravagance and villainy
      Your representation like every thing else that I ever heard you utter breathes nothing but benevolence and goodness but your pity has been abused and your understanding imposed upon Mr Harrel had no intention to destroy himself the whole was an infamous trick which had not your generosity been too well known would never have been played
      It is impossible not to revere your scruples even while I consider them as causeless for causeless they undoubtedly were the man who could act so atrocious a part who could so scandalously pillage a young lady who was his guest and his ward take advantage of her temper for the plunder of her fortune and extort her compliance by the basest and most dishonourable arts meant only to terrify her into compliance for he can be nothing less than a downright and thorough scoundrel capable of every species of mean villainy
      His bonds his rents what is a man’s bond who is not worth a guinea and what are his rents when all he ever owned must be sold before they are due and when he will not himself receive a penny from the sale as he has neither land house nor possession of any sort that is not mortgaged
This is very youthful philosophy but it will not lessen your regret hereafter when the value of money is better known to you
He is a wretch and deserves the full force of the disgrace he is courting What is now most necessary is to guard you from his further machinations for you may else be involved in ruin as deep as his own He now knows the way to frighten you and he will not fail to put it in practice
      Your resolution will be as feeble as your generosity will be potent depend nothing upon yourself but instantly quit his house You will else be made responsible for every debt that he contracts and whatever may be his difficulties hereafter he will know that to extricate himself from them he has but to talk of dying and to shew you a sword or a pistol
      I mention not Mr Briggs as an eligible host but merely as one more proper for you than Mr Delvile with whom your fixing at present would be but ill thought of in the world
      Because he has a son for whose sake alone it would be universally concluded you changed your abode and to give any pretence for such a report would by no means accord with the usual delicacy of your conduct
I will not ask whither you are going so early or upon what errand for I must beg a moment’s audience be your business what it may
Miss Beverley you must fly this house directly it is the region of disorder and licentiousness and unfit to contain you
      I have taken care for some time past to be well informed of all the proceedings of Mr Harrel and the intelligence I procured this morning is of the most alarming nature I find he spent the night before the last entirely at a gaming table where intoxicated by a run of good luck he passed the whole of the next day in rioting with his profligate intimates and last night returning again to his favourite amusement he not only lost all he had gained but much more than he could pay Doubt not therefore but you will be called upon to assist him he still considers you as his resource in times of danger and while he knows you are under his roof he will always believe himself secure
      The character of a gamester depends solely upon his luck his disposition varies with every throw of the dice and he is airy gay and good humoured or sour morose and savage neither from nature nor from principle but wholly by the caprice of chance
      This is a manœuvre I have been some time expecting but Mr Harrel though artful and selfish is by no means deep The plan he had formed would have succeeded with some women and he therefore concluded it would with all So many of your sex have been subdued by perseverance and so many have been conquered by boldness that he supposed when he united two such powerful besiegers in the person of a Baronet he should vanquish all obstacles By assuring you that the world thought the marriage already settled he hoped to surprise you into believing there was no help for it and by the suddenness and vehemence of the attack to frighten and hurry you into compliance His own wife he knew might have been managed thus with ease and so probably might his sister and his mother and his cousin for in love matters or what are so called women in general are readily duped He discerned not the superiority of your understanding to tricks so shallow and impertinent nor the firmness of your mind in maintaining its own independence No doubt but he was amply to have been rewarded for his assistance and probably had you this morning been propitious the Baronet in return was to have cleared him from his present difficulty
      Rest no security upon yourself since you have no knowledge of the many tricks and inventions by which you may yet be plundered Perhaps he may beg permission to reside in your house in Suffolk or desire an annuity for his wife or chuse to receive your first rents when you come of age and whatever he may fix upon his dagger and his bowl will not fail to procure him A heart so liberal as yours can only be guarded by flight You were going you said when I came and whither
      Indeed is young Delvile then going abroad 
      Nay I only imagined it from your chusing to reside in his house
      Certainly nor should I have supposed he had any chance with you had I not hitherto observed that your convenience has always been sacrificed to your sense of propriety
      And when 
      Why not this morning
      You thought otherwise when I came you were then content to leave her
The other 1000 l I know not how he obtained but he certainly had three You I hope were not so unguarded  
      O fie to suffer your understanding to be lulled asleep because the weak-minded Mr Arnott’s could not be kept awake I thought after such cautions from me and such experience of your own you could not again have been thus duped
      Yet you see the utter inutility of the attempt you see and I told you beforehand that nothing could save him
      You have indeed fallen into most worthless hands and the Dean was much to blame for naming so lightly a guardian to a fortune such as yours
      But if he knew not the various subterfuges by which such a caution might be baffled he ought to have taken advice of those who were better informed Mr Briggs too what a wretch mean low vulgar sordid the whole city of London I believe could not produce such another how unaccountable to make you the ward of a man whose house you cannot enter without disgust
      But does not the city at this time abound in families where while your fortune was in security you might yourself have lived with propriety Nothing requires circumspection so minute as the choice of a guardian to a girl of large fortune and in general one thing only is attended to an appearance of property Morals integrity character are either not thought of or investigated so superficially that the enquiry were as well wholly omitted
      His flightiness proceeded not from gaiety of heart it was merely the effect of effort and his spirits were as mechanical as his taste for diversion He had not strong parts nor were his vices the result of his passions had œconomy been as much in fashion as extravagance he would have been equally eager to practice it he was a mere time-server he struggled but to be something and having neither talents nor sentiment to know what he looked around him for any pursuit and seeing distinction was more easily attained in the road to ruin than in any other he gallopped along it thoughtless of being thrown when he came to the bottom and sufficiently gratified in shewing his horsemanship by the way
Aye prithee do Morrice but don’t omit to relate also what we said of yourself
O that won’t pass I assure you we shall tell another tale at table by and by and bring the old proverb of the ill luck of listeners upon you in its full force
      Why you won’t pretend you did not hear Miss Beverley say you were the truest Ouran Outang or man-monkey she ever knew
      No Nor how much she admired your dexterity in escaping being horse-whipt three times a day for your incurable impudence
      Ay and not only horse-whipt but horse-ponded for she thought when one had heated the other might cool you and then you might be fitted again for your native woods for she insists upon it you were brought from Africa and are not yet half tamed
      Pho pho why he heard it himself the whole time and so shall all our party by and bye if I can but remember to mention it
      I am come to speak with Miss Beverley upon business of some importance
      Good God Miss Beverley what is this you have done bound yourself to marry a man who despises who scorns who refuses to own you
      See you not the indignity which is offered you Does the loose the flimsy veil with which it is covered hide it from your understanding or disguise it from your delicacy
To convenience to contempt to derision to insolence 
      You are deceived grossly deceived if you doubt their truth for a moment they are not indeed even decently concealed from you they are glaring as the day and wilful blindness can alone obscure them
      Let me not offend you my dear Miss Beverley by a freedom which results merely from a solicitude to serve you and which the length and intimacy of our acquaintance had I hoped long since authorised I know not how to see you on the brink of destruction without speaking yet if you are averse to my sincerity I will curb it and have done
      You cannot but be certain that my zeal proceeds wholly from a desire to be of use to you my knowledge of the world might possibly I thought assist your inexperience and the disinterestedness of my regard might enable me to see and to point out the dangers to which you are exposed from artifice and duplicity in those who have other purposes to answer than what simply belong to your welfare
      You are too generous to perceive the difference or you would find nothing less alike If however my plainness will not offend you before it is quite too late I will point out to you a few of the evils for there are some I cannot even mention which at this instant do not merely threaten but await you
      I see your determination admits no appeal The consequence must indeed be all your own but I am greatly grieved to find how little you are aware of its seriousness Hereafter you will wish perhaps that the friend of your earliest youth had been permitted to advise you at present you only think him officious and impertinent and therefore he can do nothing you will be so likely to approve as quitting you I wish you then greater happiness than seems prepared to follow you and a counsellor more prosperous in offering his assistance
      Not unless you wish it
Are you then sensible you have gone wrong yet resolute not to turn back
      What then can possibly be your doubt To be as you were yesterday what is wanting but your own inclination
      These scruples are merely romantic your own good sense had it fairer play would contemn them but it is warped at present by prejudice and prepossession
      Yet you will neither hear whither it may lead you nor which way you may escape from it
      Briefly then I will tell you It will lead you into a family of which every individual will disdain you it will make you inmate of an house of which no other inmate will associate with you you will be insulted as an inferior and reproached as an intruder your birth will be a subject of ridicule and your whole race only named with derision and while the elders of the proud castle treat you with open contempt the man for whom you suffer will not dare to support you
      The latter part is of all other least disputable the man who now dares not own will then never venture to defend you On the contrary to make peace for himself he will be the first to neglect you The ruined estates of his ancestors will be repaired by your fortune while the name which you carry into his family will be constantly resented as an injury you will thus be plundered though you are scorned and told to consider yourself honoured that they condescend to make use of you nor here rests the evil of a forced connection with so much arrogance even your children should you have any will be educated to despise you
      Fly from it then while it is yet in your power when two paths are before you chuse not that which leads to destruction send instantly after Delvile and tell him you have recovered your senses
      All art and baseness to prevent your recantation
      In what place were you to meet you can at least send to him there
      Is this your only objection
      Then you would give up this ill-boding connection but from notions of delicacy with regard to the time
      I then will obviate this objection give me but the commission either verbally or in writing and I will undertake to find him out and deliver it before night
      I will say to him all that is necessary trust the matter with me
      I could not deliver it to a man who was not to be found I was this moment coming to acquaint how vainly I had sought him but still that your journey is unnecessary unless voluntary since I have left it at the house where you told me you should meet to-morrow morning and where he must then unavoidably receive it
      I would not tell him of the anxiety of his family I thought it would come more powerfully from yourself who having seen can better enforce it
      Your language is wonderfully altered within this twelvemonth the worthlessness of human nature the miseries of life this from you so lately the champion of human nature and the panegyrist of human life
      It must be owned after what you have suffered from this world you were wont to defend there is little reason to wonder at some change in your opinion
      And what is this independence which has thus bewitched your imagination a mere idle dream of romance and enthusiasm without existence in nature without possibility in life In uncivilised countries or in lawless times independence for a while may perhaps stalk abroad but in a regular government ’tis only the vision of a heated brain one part of a community must inevitably hang upon another and ’tis a farce to call either independent when to break the chain by which they are linked would prove destruction to both The soldier wants not the officer more than the officer the soldier nor the tenant the landlord more than the landlord the tenant The rich owe their distinction their luxuries to the poor as much as the poor owe their rewards their necessaries to the rich
      But who is there in the whole world extensive as it is and dissimilar as are its inhabitants that can pretend to assert his thoughts words and actions are exempt from controul even where interest which you so much disdain interferes not though where that is I confess I cannot tell are we not kept silent where we wish to reprove by the fear of offending and made speak where we wish to be silent by the desire of obliging do we not bow to the scoundrel as low as to the man of honour are we not by mere forms kept standing when tired made give place to those we despise and smiles to those we hate or if we refuse these attentions are we not regarded as savages and shut out of society
      Where then do you draw the line and what is the boundary beyond which your independence must not step
      You will not indeed then have a very numerous acquaintance if this is the description of those with whom you purpose to associate but is it possible you imagine you can live by such notions why the Carthusian in his monastery who is at least removed from temptation is not mortified so severely as a man of spirit living in the world who would prescribe himself such rules
      And is this plan nothing more than turning Knight-errant to the Booksellers
      I suppose then if a man wants a biting lampoon or an handsome panegyric some news-paper scandal or a sonnet for a lady 
spoken like a man of honour and one whose works may profit the world
      Let fortune turn which way it will you may defy all its malice while possessed of a spirit of enjoyment which nothing can subdue
      A strange flighty character yet of uncommon capacity and full of genius Were he less imaginative wild and eccentric he has abilities for any station and might fix and distinguish himself almost where-ever he pleased
I see what you cannot but suspect and I will go myself to Mr Delvile and insist upon his clearing me
      It is true I dislike the Delvile’s and have always disliked them they appear to me a jealous vindictive and insolent race and I should have thought I betrayed the faithful regard I professed for you had I concealed my opinion when I saw you in danger of forming an alliance with them I spoke to you therefore with honest zeal thoughtless of any enmity I might draw upon myself but though it was an interference from which I hoped by preventing the connection to contribute to your happiness it was not with a design to stop it at the expence of your character a design black horrible and diabolical a design which must be formed by a Dæmon but which even a Dæmon could never I think execute
      You trifle with your own happiness by witnessing these scenes of distress and you will trifle away your fortune upon projects you can never fulfil the very air in those miserable houses is unwholesome for you to breathe you will soon be infected with some of the diseases to which you so incautiously expose yourself and while not half you give in charity will answer the purpose you wish you will be plundered by cheats and sharpers till you have nothing lest to bestow You must be more considerate for youself and not thus governed by Albany whose insanity is but partially cured and whose projects are so boundless that the whole capital of the East Indian Company would not suffice to fulfil them
To Mrs MORTIMER DELVILE
      Those who could ever believe you guilty must have been eager to think you so I meant but your welfare at all times and to have saved you from a connection I never thought equal to your merit I am grieved but not surprised to hear of your injuries from the alliance you have formed nothing else could be expected if my testimony to your innocence can however serve to mitigate them I scruple not to declare I believe it without taint

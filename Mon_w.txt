To Mrs MORTIMER DELVILE

      Those who could ever believe you guilty must have been eager to think you so I meant but your welfare at all times and to have saved you from a connection I never thought equal to your merit I am grieved but not surprised to hear of your injuries from the alliance you have formed nothing else could be expected if my testimony to your innocence can however serve to mitigate them I scruple not to declare I believe it without taint

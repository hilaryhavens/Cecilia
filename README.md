**Text analysis of language from Frances Burney's <i>Cecilia</i>**

The six txt files represent all spoken (s) and written (w) language by Mortimer Delvile (Del), Mr. Harrel (Har), and Mr. Monckton (Mon) in Frances Burney's _Cecilia_ (1782).  The combinations should be apparent in the labeling, and the spoken and written files for both characters (_sw) were used in the text analysis.  Using text search for Delvile, Harrel, and Monckton, I identified every conversation in which those three characters took place, and after reading those conversations carefully, extracted only their spoken (and written) text.  Punctuation marks and all narration were removed.

Using Python's Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), I analyzed word frequencies, related words, parts of speech, and sentiment in all of their spoken language to highlight similarities and differences between the three characters.  These results can be found in the Jupyter Notebook file, and are discussed at greater length in my SEASECS conference paper and corresponding PowerPoint.
